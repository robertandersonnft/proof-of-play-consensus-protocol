# proof-of-play-consensus-protocol
 Proof-of-Play Consensus Protocol (PoP-CP) is a verifiable consensus framework for competitive gaming and AI agent-based action systems. It provides cryptographic proof that a match or task was executed authentically, by real players or agents, &amp; records the outcome immutably on-chain.  Replaces unverifiable outcomes with provable gameplay receipts
